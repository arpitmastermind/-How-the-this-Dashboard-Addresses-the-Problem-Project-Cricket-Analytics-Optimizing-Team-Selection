## Problem Statement

Traditional cricket team selection often relies heavily on:

Subjective assessment: Selection based solely on experience, reputation, or recent performances can overlook potential talent or fail to account for specific match conditions.

Limited data analysis: Important historical data on player performance against various opponents, on different pitches, or under varying circumstances might not be thoroughly considered.

Lack of comprehensive insights: A holistic view of player strengths, weaknesses, and compatibility within the team structure might be missing during selection.
Impact of the Problem:

Predictive modeling: Develop algorithms that predict player performance under specific circumstances, further aiding in strategic team selection.
Real-time data analysis: Integrate live data feeds during matches to provide insights into player performance and suggest potential tactical adjustments.

Potential Enhancements:

Advanced Customer Segmentation: Integrate customer demographics (age, location) and purchase behavior (frequency, average order value) to create more granular customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.
Drill-Down Functionality: Allow users to explore details behind the high-level metrics. Clicking on a specific state could reveal data on top-selling products or customer demographics within that region.
Additional Metrics: Include key metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and product profitability for a more comprehensive understanding of customer acquisition costs, customer value, and product performance.
By incorporating these improvements, the dashboard can become a more powerful tool for informed decision-making in various areas:

Sales & Marketing: Optimize marketing campaigns based on customer insights and product performance data.
Product Management: Focus product development based on sales trends and identify opportunities for product improvement based on customer preferences.
Customer Service: Gain insights into customer behavior to improve the overall customer experience.
